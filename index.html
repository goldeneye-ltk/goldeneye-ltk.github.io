            <h3>Multiplayer fixes:</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed camera disorientation when respawning</li>
                <li>Fixed random player orientation when respawning</li>

            <h3>General improvements:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic firing rate (the game will adjust the firing rate so guns fire at their normal rate when the game hits 60 FPS)</li>
                <li>Dynamic LODs (low-detail LODs only appear when the game runs at 20 FPS or worse)</li>
                <li>Stereo sound in single player (yeah, the OG game is mono)</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Performance improvements:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Better framerate that can make it difficult to go back to the OG game when playing on real hardware.</li>
                <li>Added an Anti-aliasing cheat which can improve the FPS by as much as 5 frames.</li>
                <li>If the music was completely disabled, it won't be processed when playing multiplayer, thus improving the framerate a bit.</li>
                <li>Optimized Stand Tiles line of sight algorithm to be 5x faster. Reduces lag when many guards on screen.</li>
                <li>Recompressed assets using a 4x faster algorithm (LZ4). Reduces lag and frameskips, such as lag that occurs when switching weapons.</li>
                <li>Reduced lag due to watch (watch now always runs at a minimum of 30 FPS, there is no framerate jittering when opening or closing the watch)</li>
                <li>Various optimizations that make the game run at a better framerate such as code rewritten to make it more cache-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Single-player bug fixes:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Baron Samedi boss freezing</li>
                <li>Fixed crate guards freezing on every level</li>

            </ul>
