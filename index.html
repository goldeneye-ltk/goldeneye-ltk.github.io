            <h3>Multiplayer fixes:</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed camera disorientation when respawning</li>
                <li>Fixed random player orientation when respawning</li>
                <li>Fixed mines not detonating when another player is shooting</li>
                <li>Fixed players surviving with zero health when shot in LTK mode (also known as "ghost health")</li>
                <li>Fixed projectiles passing through the map on Cradle</li>
                <li>Fixed the body hitboxes of five characters</li>
                <li>Fixed the POV height for three female characters</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>General improvements:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic firing rate (the game will adjust the firing rate so guns fire at their normal rate when the game hits 60 FPS)</li>
                <li>Dynamic LODs (low-detail LODs only appear when the game runs at 20 FPS or worse)</li>
                <li>Stereo sound in single player (yeah, the OG game is mono)</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Performance improvements:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Better framerate that can make it difficult to go back to the OG game when playing on real hardware.</li>
                <li>If the music was completely disabled, it won't be processed when playing multiplayer, thus improving the framerate a bit.</li>
                <li>Optimized Stand Tiles line of sight algorithm to be 5x faster. Reduces lag when many guards on screen.</li>
                <li>Recompressed assets using a 4x faster algorithm (lz4). Reduces lag and frameskips, such as lag that occurs when switching weapons.</li>
                <li>Reduced lag due to watch (watch now always runs at a minimum of 30 FPS, there is no framerate jittering when opening or closing the watch)</li>
                <li>Various optimizations that make the game run at a better framerate such as code rewritten to make it more cache-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Single-player bug fixes:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Baron Samedi boss freezing</li>
                <li>Fixed crate guards freezing on every level</li>
                <li>No-gravity projectiles fix (Bunker 2)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Incomplete:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A dual-wielding player only drops a single copy of their gun upon dying</li>
                <li>Anti-aliasing cheat isn't yet implemented</li>
                <li>Four new multiplayer levels coming in the next version</li>
                <li>More "meme" multiplayer cheats</li>
                <li>Finer controls on custom match length screen</li>
                <li>It's very likely that the spawn in the top room on Temple will be reversed to face the other direction</li>
            </ul>
